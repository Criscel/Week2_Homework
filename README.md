# Welcome to My First Responsive Portfolio

## Description
Mainly using Bootstrap to make a responsive website that changes depending on the screensizes.


## Installation

First creating 3 .HTML for the pages (index, portfolio and contact). Then copying links from Boostrap and creating a seperate .CSS file for all the alterations needed

## Usage

This webpage consist of 3 linked pages, The Home or Index page, the Portfolio page and the Contact Me page.
The menus needs to be present and active on the navbar that changes into hamburger icon depending on the size of the browser.

## Credits

 - [Bootstrap] (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/)
 - [Markup_Validation_Service] (https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload)

## Difficulties

I failed to check the responsiveness of the page it is open on a mobile phone screen. I got really confused on how to use @media syntax.  Definitely must review the lectures and slide given by Bryan. 

### Jekyll Themes

My pages uses the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme that I have selected [Thanks to Github!:) ].
